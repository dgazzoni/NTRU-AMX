This folder contains the files for accessing cycle counters.
For Raspberry Pi 4, please go to the folder ``../enable_ccr`` and type ``make install`` before using `hal.c`.
For Apple M1 SoC, use the file ``m1cycles.c``.
Notice that the number of counters is different between Apple M1 Air and Apple M1 Pro.
